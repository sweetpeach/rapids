|`[COMPUTE]`                                  | Set to `True` to extract `FITBIT_SLEEP_INTRADAY` features from the `RAPIDS` provider|
|`[FEATURES]`                                 |         Features to be computed from sleep intraday data, see table below           |
|`[SLEEP_LEVELS]`                             | Fitbitâ€™s sleep API Version 1 only provides `CLASSIC` records. However, Version 1.2 provides 2 types of records: `CLASSIC` and `STAGES`. `STAGES` is only available in devices with a heart rate sensor and even those devices will fail to report it if the battery is low or the device is not tight enough. While `CLASSIC` contains 3 sleep levels (`awake`, `restless`, and `asleep`), `STAGES` contains 4 sleep levels (`wake`, `deep`, `light`, `rem`). To make it consistent, RAPIDS groups them into 2 `UNIFIED` sleep levels: `awake` (`CLASSIC`: `awake` and `restless`; `STAGES`: `wake`) and `asleep` (`CLASSIC`: `asleep`; `STAGES`: `deep`, `light`, and `rem`). In this section, there is a boolean flag named `INCLUDE_ALL_GROUPS` that if set to TRUE, computes LEVELS_AND_TYPES features grouping all levels together in a single `all` category.
|`[SLEEP_TYPES]`                              | Types of sleep to be included in the feature extraction computation. There are three sleep types: `main`, `nap`, and `all`. The `all` type means both main sleep and naps are considered.
|`[INCLUDE_SLEEP_LATER_THAN]`| All resampled sleep rows (bin interval: one minute) that started after this time will be included in the feature computation. It is a number ranging from 0 (midnight) to 1439 (23:59) which denotes the number of minutes after midnight. If a segment is longer than one day, this value is for every day.
|`[ROUTINE_REFERENCE_TIME]`| The reference point from which the `[ROUTINE]` features are to be computed. Chosen from `MIDNIGHT` and `START_OF_THE_SEGMENT`, default is `MIDNIGHT`. If you have multiple time segments per day it might be more informative to set this flag to `START_OF_THE_SEGMENT`.

!!! note "Assumptions/Observations"
    1. Deleting values from `[SLEEP_LEVELS]` or `[SLEEP_TYPES]` will only change the features you receive from `[LEVELS_AND_TYPES]`. For example if `STAGES` only contains `[rem, light]` you will not receive `countepisode[wake|deep][TYPE]` or sum, max, min, avg, median, or std `duration`. These values will not influence `RATIOS` or `ROUTINE` features.
    2. Any `[LEVEL]` grouping is done within the elements of each class `CLASSIC`, `STAGES`, and `UNIFIED`. That is, we never combine `CLASSIC` or `STAGES` types to compute features when `INCLUDE_ALL_GROUPS` is True or when computing `RATIOS`.
    3. `all` levels or `all` sleep types will not be considered for ratios features even though `INCLUDE_ALL_GROUPS` is True and `all` is in `SLEEP_TYPES` as those features will always be 1.

!!! note "Assumptions/Observations"
    1. These features are based on descriptive statistics computed across daily values (start/end/mid times of sleep episodes). This is the reason why they are only available on time segments that are longer than 24 hours (we need at least 1 day to get the average).
    2. Even though Fitbit provides 2 types of sleep episodes (`main` and `nap`), only `main` sleep episodes are considered.
    3. How do we assign sleep episodes to specific dates?
    
        `START_TIME` and `LENGTH` control the dates that sleep episodes belong to. For a pair of `[START_TIME]` and `[LENGTH]`, sleep episodes (blue boxes) can only be placed at the following places:

        <figure>
            <img src="../../img/features_fitbit_sleep_intraday.png" max-width="100%" />
            <figcaption>Relationship between sleep episodes and the given times`([START_TIME], [LENGTH])`</figcaption>
        </figure>

        - If the end time of a sleep episode is before `[START_TIME]`, it will belong to the day before its start date (e.g. sleep episode #1).

        - if (1) the start time or the end time of a sleep episode are between (overlap) `[START_TIME]` and `[START_TIME] + [LENGTH]` or (2) the start time is before `[START_TIME]` and the end time is after `[START_TIME] + [LENGTH]`, it will belong to its start date (e.g. sleep episode #2, #3, #4, #5).

        - If the start time of a sleep episode is after `START_TIME] + [LENGTH]`, it will belong to the day after its start date (e.g. sleep episode #6).
        
        Only `main` sleep episodes that intersect or contain the period between `[START_TIME]` and `[START_TIME] + [LENGTH]` will be included in the feature computation. If we process the following `main` sleep episodes: 

        | episode |start|end|
        |-|-|-|
        |1|2021-02-01 12:00|2021-02-01 15:00|
        |2|2021-02-01 21:00|2021-02-02 03:00|02-01
        |3|2021-02-02 05:00|2021-02-02 08:00|02-01
        |4|2021-02-02 11:00|2021-02-02 14:00|
        |5|2021-02-02 19:00|2021-02-03 06:00|02-02

        And our parameters:

        - `[INCLUDE_EPISODES_INTERSECTING][START_TIME]` = 1320 (today's 22:00)

        - `[INCLUDE_EPISODES_INTERSECTING][LENGTH]` = 720 (tomorrow's 10:00, or 22:00 + 12 hours)
        
        Only sleep episodes 2, 3,and 5 would be considered.
    
    4. Time related features represent the number of minutes between the start/end/midpoint of sleep episodes and the assigned day's midnight.

    5. All `main` sleep episodes are chunked within the requested [time segments](../../setup/configuration/#time-segments) which need to be at least 24 hours or more long (1, 2, 3, 7 days, etc.). Then, daily features will be extracted and averaged across the length of the time segment, for example:
    
        The daily features extracted on 2021-02-01 will be:

        - starttimeofepisodemain (bedtime) is `21 * 60` (episode 2 start time 2021-02-01 21:00)
